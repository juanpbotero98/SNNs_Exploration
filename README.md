# SNNs_Exploration
Repository for exploring SNN platforms such as Nengo and spikeTorch

## Installation procedure
### Running Nengo-DL
Nengo-Dl is built on top of tensorflow, for that matter a TF installation is needed. For GPU access TF now requires to have WSL2, so a linux distribution on Windows.
To achieve that I followed the instructions on [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/wsl/setup/environment) link. I then set up VScode to run the virtual machine as a server following the instructions on [this](https://learn.microsoft.com/es-es/windows/wsl/tutorials/wsl-vscode) link.
